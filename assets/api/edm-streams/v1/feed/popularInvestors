That’s why I want to say a heartfelt thank you for your continued trust. It truly means a lot to me! 🙏\n\nI hope you use these days to enjoy some quality time with family, friends – or simply for yourself.\n\nAnd if you find a golden egg - please shake it before you bite into it! 😅🥚🪙\n\nWishing you a joyful Easter and some well-earned downtime.\nBest regards,\nLuca

I prezzi sono in laterale da diverse settimane, ma i segnali tecnici e i dati on-chain stanno cominciando a disegnare uno scenario interessante, soprattutto in ottica medio-lungo termine.\n\nA livello tecnico, Ethereum mostra un potenziale pattern di inversione su timeframe settimanale: un testa e spalle inverso, attualmente ancora in formazione, che si inserisce in un più ampio triangolo ascendente. Questo tipo di configurazione è tipicamente rialzista e suggerisce che, in caso di rottura della zona di resistenza tra i 3600 e i 4000 dollari, potremmo assistere a un'accelerazione significativa verso nuovi livelli.\n\nPer ora però, il mercato sembra voler \"scaricare\" l’eccesso di speculazione post-Bitcoin halving, e anche Ethereum sta beneficiando di una sorta di reset dell’RSI settimanale. Questo può essere interpretato come un momento di riaccumulazione, un po' come succede nei cicli precedenti prima delle grandi ripartenze.\n\nSul fronte fondamentale, i dati on-chain parlano chiaro: le whale (wallet tra 1000 e 10000 ETH) stanno accumulando in silenzio, mentre il numero di nuovi indirizzi continua a crescere in modo costante. Questo suggerisce che l’interesse per Ethereum non si è affatto spento, anzi, sta aumentando sotto traccia.\n\nNel breve periodo, Ethereum resta in una zona neutra. Finché non verranno rotti al rialzo i 1800 dollari con convinzione, è difficile parlare di inversione vera e propria. Al ribasso, il supporto chiave resta in area 1500, con soglia psicologica attorno ai 1400 come livello di ultima difesa.\n\nGuardando al medio termine, la seconda metà del 2025 potrebbe essere il momento in cui inizieremo a vedere i primi segnali concreti di bull run. Se il pattern si confermasse e la struttura tecnica venisse rispettata, Ethereum potrebbe puntare ai 4000 dollari come primo obiettivo, con possibilità di estensione anche verso i 5000-6000 nei mesi successivi.\n\nNel lungo periodo, se il ciclo attuale replicasse anche solo parzialmente quello del 2020-2021, Ethereum avrebbe spazio per tornare sopra i suoi massimi storici e spingersi anche fino ai 7000 dollari. Naturalmente molto dipenderà dal contesto macro, dalla regolamentazione e da eventuali catalizzatori come l’approvazione di un ETF spot o un’evoluzione concreta del layer 2.\n\nIn conclusione, Ethereum si trova in una fase delicata ma potenzialmente esplosiva. Non è ancora tempo di euforia, ma i segnali da osservare sono tutti lì, sul grafico. \n\nOcchi aperti su volume, breakout sopra i 2000 dollari e sulla forza del trend settimanale. Se quei livelli verranno superati con convinzione, potremmo essere davvero all'inizio di una nuova fase impulsiva. \n\n📣 𝗩𝗨𝗢𝗜 𝗘𝗦𝗣𝗢𝗥𝗧𝗜 𝗔𝗟 𝗙𝗨𝗧𝗨𝗥𝗢?

Puoi partire con 500$, ma è la costanza che cambia tutto: ogni piccolo contributo mensile moltiplica l’effetto nel tempo.\n\n👉 Il segreto è la costanza: aggiungi capitale anche poco per volta, mese dopo mese.\n\n👉 È una strategia pensata per il lungo termine, dove ogni correzione di mercato diventa un’opportunità\n\n👉 Non cerco “colpi di fortuna”, ma crescite solide nel tempo.\n\nQuesto approccio serve a massimizzare i guadagni quando i mercati crescono, e minimizzare i rischi nei momenti difficili, grazie alla diversificazione, al reinvestimento, e alla pazienza.\n\n💡 Non servono competenze tecniche. Ti basta andare sul mio profilo e poi cliccare su “Copia”.

In questo periodo di crescita, ci sembrava utile condividere alcune nozioni chiave sugli investimenti, che possono essere utili a chi è appena arrivato, ma anche a chi ha già esperienza e cerca di perfezionare la propria strategia.\n\n- Volatilità implicita vs volatilità storica: La volatilità implicita è quella prezzata dal mercato tramite le opzioni ed è legata alle aspettative future, mentre la volatilità storica è il movimento effettivo del prezzo nel passato. Comprendere questa differenza è cruciale per chi vuole fare investimenti a lungo termine, perché una bassa volatilità implicita può suggerire che i mercati non si aspettano cambiamenti significativi, mentre un aumento improvviso può segnalare un periodo di incertezze macroeconomiche.\n\n- Liquidità e slippage: La liquidità, in un contesto di investimenti, non riguarda solo la capacità di entrare o uscire da una posizione, ma anche la possibilità di fare transazioni senza che il prezzo dell’asset venga influenzato dalla nostra azione. Quando si parla di slippage, ci si riferisce alla differenza tra il prezzo atteso e quello effettivo di esecuzione, che può essere più pronunciata nei mercati meno liquidi, specialmente durante eventi macroeconomici significativi.\n\n- Correlazione e diversificazione: La correlazione tra asset è un concetto fondamentale. Investire in asset altamente correlati (come due titoli tecnologici) non porta a una vera diversificazione. Un portafoglio ben diversificato deve includere asset con bassa o negativa correlazione, come azioni e obbligazioni, o persino azioni di diversi settori industriali che rispondono in modo differente alle variabili economiche.\n\n- Risk-adjusted return (Rendimento corretto per il rischio): Quando si valuta un investimento, non basta guardare al rendimento assoluto, ma bisogna considerare quanto rischio è stato assunto per ottenerlo. Il Sharpe ratio e il Sortino ratio sono due strumenti essenziali che permettono di misurare l’efficacia di un investimento rispetto al rischio corso.\n\n- Investimenti tematici e megatrend: Investire in settori emergenti come la green economy, tecnologie avanzate o l'intelligenza artificiale non è solo una questione di interesse, ma di capire quali trend globali potrebbero modellare il futuro dei mercati. Il rischio di non essere esposti a questi megatrend è il rischio di rimanere indietro.\n\n- Valutazione del rischio geopolitico e macroeconomico: Anche se siamo tutti concentrati su fondamentali aziendali e performance dei titoli, l’impatto di eventi geopolitici (guerre, politiche fiscali, cambiamenti normativi) non può essere ignorato. Questi eventi, a lungo termine, possono alterare le valutazioni di interi settori.\n\nQueste sono solo alcune delle nozioni che ci guidano nelle scelte di investimento a lungo termine. La nostra visione è orientata alla solidità e alla sostenibilità del portafoglio, tenendo sempre presente che il miglior modo per proteggere il proprio capitale è essere consapevoli e preparati.\n\nGrazie ancora per la fiducia. Il viaggio è appena cominciato.\n\n$SPX500 $BTC $NSDQ100 $DJ30 $NVDA ","languageCode":"it-it"},"updated":"2025-04-18T08:36:40.916Z","isDeleted":false,"type":"Default","metadata":{},"attachments":[],"tags":[{"market":{"id":"27","symbolName":"SPX500","displayName":"SPX500 Index (Non Expiry)","updated":"2025-04-18T09:09:15.214Z","assetType":"Index","internalId":27,"avatar":{"small":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/market-avatars/spx500/70x70.png","medium":"/medium/S&P.png","large":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/market-avatars/spx500/150x150.png"},"application":"eToro","metadata":""}},{"market":{"id":"100000","symbolName":"BTC","displayName":"Bitcoin","updated":"2025-04-18T09:09:15.276Z","assetType":"CryptoCoin","internalId":100000,"avatar":{"small":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/market-avatars/btc/80x80.png","medium":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/market-avatars/btc/90x90.png","large":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/market-avatars/btc/150x150.png"},"application":"eToro","metadata":""}},{"market":{"id":"28","symbolName":"NSDQ100","displayName":"NASDAQ100 Index (Non Expiry)","updated":"2025-04-18T09:09:15.214Z","assetType":"Index","internalId":28,"avatar":{"small":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/market-avatars/nsdq100/70x70.png","medium":"/medium/NSDQ.png","large":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/market-avatars/nsdq100/150x150.png"},"application":"eToro","metadata":""}},{"market":{"id":"29","symbolName":"DJ30","displayName":"DJ30 Index (Non Expiry)","updated":"2025-04-18T09:09:15.214Z","assetType":"Index","internalId":29,"avatar":{"small":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/market-avatars/dj30/70x70.png","medium":"/medium/DOW.png","large":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/market-avatars/dj30/150x150.png"},"application":"eToro","metadata":""}},{"market":{"id":"1137","symbolName":"NVDA","displayName":"NVIDIA Corporation","updated":"2025-04-18T09:09:15.217Z","assetType":"Stocks","internalId":1137,"avatar":{"small":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/market-avatars/nvda/80x80.png","medium":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/market-avatars/nvda/90x90.png","large":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/market-avatars/nvda/150x150.png"},"application":"eToro","metadata":""}}],"isSpam":false,"editStatus":"None"},"commentsData":{"reactionPaging":{"totalCount":4},"comments":[{"entity":{"message":{"text":"Congratulazioni","languageCode":"it-it"},"attachments":[],"isSpam":false,"editStatus":"None","id":"4c60eee8-2b5f-4d31-8221-e9a45ad68c3d","owner":{"id":"23752314","username":"Scaccopacco","firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Santagata","avatar":{"small":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/avatars/35X35/23469340/3.jpg","medium":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/avatars/50X50/23469340/3.jpg","large":"https://etoro-cdn.etorostatic.com/avatars/150X150/23469340/3.jpg"},"roles":["PI","Verified","Regular","Depositor"],"isBlocked":false,"isPrivate":false,"countryCode":102,"piLevel":2},"obsoleteId":"4c60eee8-2b5f-4d31-8221-e9a45ad68c3d","parent":{"id":"402ca140-1c30-11f0-8080-8001646231be","obsoleteId":"402ca140-1c30-11f0-8080-8001646231be","type":"Post"},"created":"2025-04-18T09:25:00.808Z"},"repliesCount":0,"emotionsData":{"like":{"paging":{"totalCount":0}}},"requesterContext":{"isFlaggingAsSpam":false,"isSubscribed":false,"isLiking":false,"isSaved":false,"isPinned":false,"isRequesterBlocking":false,"isInteractionRestricted":false}},{"entity":{"message":{"text":"Complimenti!
